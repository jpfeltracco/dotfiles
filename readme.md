# dotfiles
## Info
These are some of my dotfiles for solarized i3 + tmux + vim + zsh. (I'm still deciding on a terminal emulator...).
- I'm working on coming up with a basic Arch linux package list, it'll probably end up committed here at some point.

## Usage
Simply do a `python setup.py` (python 3)
- setup.py will create symlinks between this repo's dotfiles and your system, dealing with existing files as the come up.
- Files to symlink and the location of the symlinks can changed by editing the `dotfiles` list in setup.py.
